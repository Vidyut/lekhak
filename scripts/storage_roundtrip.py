"""Round-trip check: does the folder tree hold everything the database does?

Read-only against the project you point it at (docs/STORAGE.md step 2). It
copies the project into a temporary directory first, opens *that*, writes the
tree, reads it back and compares every document field by field — so the
author's real manuscript is never opened for writing, never migrated, never
touched.

Two questions are answered, and they are different ones:

1. **Does what comes back equal what went in?** A field that is written and
   read back differently is a bug in the layout.
2. **Is anything in the database that the layout has no home for?** Nothing
   fails this — it is a list of what a migration would silently drop, which
   is exactly the list that has to be empty (or consciously accepted) before
   the flat pool is retired.
