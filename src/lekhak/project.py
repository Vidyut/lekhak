"""Transparent project storage: the model behind the editor.

A project is a ``.lekhak`` directory holding three things, deliberately
kept separable so a writer can inspect or recover work by hand:

- ``project.sqlite3`` — structure and metadata: the document tree
  (parent + position), titles, synopses, word counts, snapshots and
  per-document key/value metadata. Never prose.
- ``documents/<id>.html`` — one plain HTML file of prose per document.
  The manuscript itself; readable without this codebase.
- ``backups/`` — timestamped copies of both, taken on open and on save.

Flow of a document through the system:

    add_document()   creates the row, then writes an empty content file
    write_content()  atomically replaces that file (temp + fsync + rename)
                     and refreshes the cached word_count
    documents()      walks the tree in binder order (parent, then position)
    delete_document() removes rows first, then files — so a crash leaves
                     orphans on disk, never a row pointing at nothing

Structure is split from prose on purpose: read_content()/write_content()
touch only files, everything else touches only rows, and the two are
reconciled by the document id.

Export path: compile_units() walks the binder in order, renders each
document through a TemplateSet, and the export_* methods assemble those
units into the target format. Snapshots are per-document HTML copies,
taken before destructive operations (split, merge, restore) so any of
them can be reversed.
