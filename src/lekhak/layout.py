"""The filesystem layout: writing a project out as a folder tree, and reading
it back (docs/STORAGE.md).

This is the storage migration's core, built *beside* the existing database
rather than replacing it — nothing in the running application calls this yet.
It exists so the tree can be written, read back, and compared before anything
real depends on it.

It works on plain :class:`Node` values, not on the database, so it can be
tested without a project and without Qt.

Frontmatter and manifests use a documented **subset of YAML** — keys, scalars,
simple lists, and one level of nesting by indentation. No anchors, aliases,
multi-document streams or tags; no dependency (docs/STORAGE.md).
