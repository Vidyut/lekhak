"""Reading and writing a document file on disk: prose plus its metadata.

A Lekhak document is one ``.html`` file whose head carries a YAML
frontmatter block and whose body carries the prose. The file is the
truth: a writer can read it in any editor, and any tool can produce one.
Nothing here needs the database.

The metadata block is read from either of two places, because both are
in the wild:

* at the very top of the file, before ``<html>`` — the form
  ``lekhak-web`` writes and the form most other tools expect;
* inside the ``<head>`` element, between ``---`` fences — the form a
  writer's own editor produces, and the one Lekhak writes.

Whichever it is, writing always puts it at the top of the file, so
there is one canonical shape and a round trip never moves the writer's
prose around.
