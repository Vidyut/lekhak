"""Repair a folder tree that was split in two by an old bug.

A leaf that gained children used to have its new child's path worked
out **before** the leaf was promoted to a directory. The child landed in
a ghost tree — ``X.html/`` beside the real ``X/`` — and the two halves
of one binder never met again:

    Perfectly Flawed/
    ├── Sleepwise stolen/          ← the real container, and its own words
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── Stolen words.html      ← ... after the repair
    └── Sleepwise stolen.html/     ← the ghost: a directory named like a file
        └── Stolen words.html      ← the child, in the wrong tree

The tree never grows such a directory itself: a container is a directory
named after its title, and a leaf is an ``.html`` file. So a directory
whose name ends in ``.html`` is always a ghost, and this script puts
its contents back where they belong.

Nothing is destroyed: the child's own file is moved (not copied and
deleted), the ghost's own prose — if it has any — is kept as the
container's index when the container has none, and the backup is taken
before anything moves.
