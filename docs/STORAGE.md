# Storage: the filesystem *is* the structure

Status: **decided** (author, 2026-10-25). This supersedes the "metadata is
SQLite" half of the project-format working agreement in `ROADMAP.md`: metadata
moves into the files, and SQLite becomes a cache that can be rebuilt by
scanning.

## As built (2026-11-01)

The model is now the running application, not a plan.

- **The tree is on disk, in the author's own names.** A project is a folder
  with `manifest.json` at its root; every container is a directory; every
  document is an `.html` file inside it. Names keep their spaces —
  `A Fictional Book/A Chapter/1---A Meeting.html`.
- **The prose and its metadata live together.** Each file's head carries a
  YAML frontmatter block (title, synopsis, word target, kind, and the rest);
  the body is the prose. A file opened in any editor is complete on its own.
- **The database is the index.** `project.sqlite3` holds what the app needs
  to be fast, and each row carries the `path` of its own file — that column
  is the join between the two. `Project.sync_with_disk()` rebuilds the index
  by scanning, and picks up anything the writer added by hand.
- **The sequence is written twice, in two places that cannot lose it.**
  `.order.json` in each folder records that folder's children by name;
  `manifest.json` records the root's. Copy a folder anywhere and its order
  travels with it.
- **`migrate_to_tree.py`** converts a project made before this: it writes the
  tree from the old database and records the paths.

### As built (2026-11-02)

- **The binder is drawn from the files.** `Project.binder_tree()` walks the
  tree on disk and joins the index in for what only the index knows — the
  document's id, and the title the writer gave it. A folder or file the
  writer added by hand is in the binder from the moment it exists. The icon
  says what the thing *is* on disk — a directory is a folder, an `.html` file
  is a document — whatever role the row gives it, so a chapter holding scenes
  wears a folder's icon.
- **A container's own `index.html` is its prose, not a child of it.** The
  index never grows a second row for that file, and the binder never shows
  the same words twice.
- **A lock is a marker file in the tree.** `.locked` inside a folder locks
  that folder and everything inside it; `.<name>.locked` beside a file locks
  that file. The tick beside the Type row says whether the marker is there;
  the marker is the truth, and it travels with a copied folder.
- **A leaf that gains children moves before its child is placed.** The
  child's path is worked out *after* the promotion from `X.html` to the
  directory `X/`, so the two halves of one binder cannot end up in two
  trees. `repair_tree.py` puts an older split back together — it finds the
  ghost directories (a directory named like a file), moves their contents
  where they belong, and takes a backup before it touches anything.

The rest of this document is the design record — the reasoning, the decisions
and the experiments that led here. Where it describes the planned `.lekhak/`
machinery, read it as the proposal that the simpler `manifest.json` +
`.order.json` shape replaced.

## Why

- **Extract and nest.** Copy `Book Three/` out and open it as its own project;
  drop it back and it is a folder again. A series can live in one collection
  while a WIP is opened on its own without touching published books.
- **Portability.** Copy a project folder to your editor; it opens, with its
  templates inside it.
- **Legibility.** A file manager shows the book's shape, and Git shows prose
  diffs rather than a database blob.
- **The Obsidian property:** any folder can be a project, so the unit of work
  is whatever the writer carved out.

## Layout

```
My Novel.lekhak/          ← a project: a folder with manifest.json
├── manifest.json                   ← title, format version, root child order
├── project.sqlite3                 ← the index: metadata, search, history
├── Book Three/
│   ├── .order.json                 ← the order of this folder's children
│   ├── Chapter-12.html             ← prose + frontmatter
│   └── Scene-Two-People-Meet.html
├── templates/                      ← the template sets, recognised by name
└── images/
```

The `.lekhak` **suffix is a convention**, not a requirement: any folder
containing `manifest.json` is a project.

**Nothing else lives in the project.** No `documents/` store, no `backups/`
folder: the first is gone now that each document is a real file in the tree,
and the second because a project that is lost must not take its backups with
it. A project folder holds the book and the index, and nothing more.

**The database is an index, not the store.** It carries the metadata the app
needs to be quick — the word counts, the synopsis, the template assignment,
the search index — and each row remembers the path of its own file. The prose
and the metadata-in-the-file are the truth; the database is a cache that can be
rebuilt by scanning (`Project.sync_with_disk`). A folder or file the writer
added by hand is picked up on open and becomes part of the book.

**Backups live outside the project**, in a `Backups/` folder beside it (or
wherever the writer says). A backup is a copy of the whole folder tree, so it
opens like the project. The manuscript autosaves; a backup is the extra copy,
taken when the writer asks for one, when the app closes, and as often as
Preferences says otherwise.

## Documents

One file per document. Prose is HTML as it is today; everything that is not
prose lives in a **YAML frontmatter block** at the top of the file:

```html
---
title: 3 - Two People Meet
id: 5f3c…            # stable across renames
type: Scene
synopsis: One finally meets Another, and it goes badly.
word_target: 1200
metadata:
  PoV: Narrator
  Status: Draft
---
<p>…the prose…</p>
```

- **The title is the truth**; the filename is a slug derived from it. Titles
  are free text and filenames are not, so the two cannot be the same thing.
- **`id` is stable and permanent** — the thing that makes a rename harmless:
  covers keep finding their folder, snapshots and revisions keep their
  document, and an external move looks like a move rather than a delete plus a
  create. *Recommended; amend if you'd rather have no ids at all and accept
  that renames lose history and covers.*
- **Frontmatter never reaches an export.** It is stripped on the way out and
  restored on the way in — the same display-layer rule that already governs
  binder numbers and resolved links (working agreements, "Manuscripts are
  precious").
- **YAML subset.** Keys, scalars, simple lists, nested maps by indentation.
  No anchors, aliases, multi-document streams or tags. A hand-rolled parser
  keeps the two-dependency agreement intact; if the subset ever pinches, we
  move to PyYAML and record the reason then.

## Folders

**Anything with children is a directory, whatever its role.** A filesystem item
cannot be a file and a directory at once, and real binders contain chapters
that hold both their own prose *and* their scenes — the dry run against the
author's project found exactly that. So a document with children becomes a
directory, and its own words, if it has any, become **`index.html`** inside it.
A container with no prose of its own has no index file. (Whether a container's
own `index.html` exports is a question of role, settled by `Type`, not by where
it sits.)

`.order.json` inside each folder holds **the order of its children** as a
list of names. It lives *inside* the folder because a copied folder must
carry its sequence with it. The project's own root order lives in
`manifest.json`, beside the title.

Order is a list of **names**, not numeric prefixes: reordering rewrites one
small file instead of renaming every document.

**Order is never derived from filenames, and nothing sorts children by name.**
The order file *is* the order: the app writes it from the binder order, and
every reorder rewrites it. Sorting by name would scramble real binders — the
author's scene titles run `1---`, `2---`, … `10---`, which as text sort
`1, 10, 2` — and a filesystem's own enumeration order is arbitrary on top of
that. New documents append; the writer drags to reorder; the numbers in a
title stay decoration, never mechanism.

**Why the order lives in the folder as well as the manifest.** Copy, move or
extract a folder anywhere and its sequence travels with it. If `manifest.json`
is lost, the project's title and overview go with it but no root order does —
every folder still knows its own sequence, so a re-opened project is arranged
exactly as it was. If a single `.order.json` is lost, only that folder falls
back to a scan; nothing else moves.

## Stored versus indexed

| Stored (the truth) | Indexed (rebuildable) |
|---|---|
| prose, frontmatter, folder manifests | search index, word counts |
| templates, images | revisions and snapshots |
| backups | anything derivable by scanning |

**History does not travel with an extracted folder.** The prose travels, and
so do tracked changes (their marks live in the HTML), but snapshot and
revision history stays with the project it happened in. A folder split off
today starts with no history of its own.

## Projects, and opening any folder

- `manifest.json` marks a project: title, format version, root child order.
- **Opening a folder with no marker offers to make it a project** — write the
  manifest, index what is there, and let the areas appear as they are needed.
- **Converting an old project is the same code path** plus one step: read the
  old database and write the tree from it (`migrate_to_tree.py`). One
  implementation, not a converter and an opener.

## Nesting

A project marker is honoured **only at the root you opened**. Nested inside
another project, a project is a folder: its project settings are ignored, its
`.lekhak/` is machinery rather than content, and its documents are simply
content — counted, exported, reordered. Its own `Templates/` still governs its
subtree, by the nearest-wins rule, which is what lets ten books carry ten
formats inside one collection.

**Locks.** On open, check `.lekhak/lock` in the ancestors *and* immediate
descendants: warn that the same files are open at another level, and allow an
**override**, because a crashed session must not leave a project permanently
unopenable. No arbitration beyond that.

## The areas

- **`templates/`** (the project's own root) holds the template sets: one
  folder each, flat in this root, listed in the binder's Templates folder
  with the three shipped sets on top (`docs/TEMPLATES.md` §1.1). It is a
  folder of *files*, not documents — no binder rows, no flags, no jump
  rows — and the three shipped sets need no folder at all, living in the
  code and duplicable into the project. A folder named `templates` anywhere
  else is an ordinary folder: discovery is by this one location, not by a
  magic name.
- **`Trash`** is a **root-level area**: your deletes go there, mirrored into
  the same structure, and emptying it prunes the directories it emptied.
  The **name** is recognised *anywhere* to mean "not manuscript", so a nested
  project's discards never count or export; the area lists any nested `Trash/`
  as jump rows so nothing is hidden. It is not renamable, restoring means
  moving something out (with **Rename** as the default and **Overwrite**
  behind a checkbox that promises nothing about backups), and manuscript
  folders are never pruned — only explicit deletion removes them.

## Filenames: no spaces, enforced on sight

**Author's decision (2026-10-25):** *"Lekhak filenames must not contain
spaces"* — and the app enforces it rather than merely preferring it. Anybody
who can take an HTML document out of a project folder and edit it can write a
compliant filename; the alternative is a tree that every other tool reads
differently from the way Lekhak does.

- **On open, and on any rescan, non-compliant names are normalised**: spaces
  and illegal characters become a single hyphen, runs collapse, ends trim.
  Files **and folders** — a policy that stops at the last path separator is
  not a policy — and because the walk is top-down, renaming a folder needs no
  second pass for its children.
- **Files from outside are accepted, never refused.** Enforcement is a rename,
  not a rejection: bring in whatever a file manager or another editor made,
  and Lekhak tidies the names on sight.
- **Guards:** only while we hold the project lock; a single pass before any
  editing begins; never on a name that is already compliant; collisions get
  `-1`, `-2`, compared case-insensitively because macOS and Windows
  filesystems are; and every change is **reported** in the session summary, so
  no rename is a mystery. A per-project setting can switch normalisation off
  for someone deliberately syncing a project with another tool.
- **Slug rules:** the writer's own names survive. Spaces and letters in any
  script stay; only characters a filesystem refuses (`/`, `:`, control codes…)
  become `-`; the ends are trimmed of dots and spaces; a 120-character cap;
  a title with nothing in it gives its *file* the name `Untitled`;
  Windows-illegal characters and reserved names (`CON`, `NUL`, `COM1`…) are
  avoided. A name already taken in the same folder gets a number —
  `Epilogue.html` and `Epilogue-1.html` — and both read `Epilogue` in the
  binder.
- **The title is never touched.** It lives in the frontmatter; normalisation
  changes filenames only, and the writer's words are not rewritten (working
  agreements, "Manuscripts are precious"). In particular the collision suffix
  never reaches it: two documents titled `Epilogue` are `Epilogue.html` and
  `Epilogue-1.html` on disk and both read `Epilogue` in the binder, and a
  title the writer left blank stays blank rather than becoming `Untitled`.
  Only a file with no frontmatter at all borrows its title from its name —
  that one was written by another hand, and its name is all it has.

## Backups, locks, and edits from outside

- **Backups** are full-tree copies, kept **outside** the project — content
  and templates travel, and a backup can never contain backups. The default
  is a `Backups/` folder beside the project; Preferences sets the folder and
  the frequency for new projects, and one project may override both. The
  manuscript autosaves on its own, so a backup is the extra copy: on an
  explicit Ctrl+S, when the app closes, and on the hourly setting if the
  writer wants it.
- **Edits from outside are expected**: rescan when the project regains focus,
  and if a file changed on disk while it was open here, offer **Reload**,
  **Keep mine** or **Keep both** — never a silent reload, which would discard
  what is in the editor.
- **A lock is a marker file in the tree.** `.locked` inside a folder locks
  that folder and everything inside it; `.<name>.locked` beside a file locks
  that file. A locked document still opens, still reads, and can still be
  typed in — it is simply never written, and the writer is told so rather
  than losing the words quietly. Unlocking takes the marker away; nothing
  else changes.

## Risks to keep in view

- Case-insensitive filesystems (hence the collision suffix and casefolded
  comparison).
- Cloud-sync tools and hidden directories.
- Frontmatter leaking into an export if any new writer forgets to strip it.
- Lock blind spots across nesting, and stale locks.
- Folder renames cascading through children, and anything still keyed by path
  — which is what the stable `id` exists to prevent.

## Build order

1. This spec, and the `ROADMAP.md` amendment it requires.
2. **The dry-run migration tool** — read-only, run against the author's real
   project, reporting the tree it would write before anything is touched.
3. Loader and index rebuild, then the writer: create, rename, move, reorder,
   delete — atomic renames wherever the filesystem allows.
4. Trash, the areas, and the per-level lift.
5. Extract, nest and absorb — which by then is "copy a folder, open it".
6. The example/documentation project, authored as markdown in the repo.

## Built overnight (2026-10-25, unattended shift)

Verified: `641 tests, exit 0`. Nothing in the running application changed —
this is all groundwork, deliberately beside the database.

- **`docs/STORAGE.md`** (this file) — the decided model, plus the `ROADMAP.md`
  amendment the format-contract clause required.
- **`scripts/storage_layout_dryrun.py`** — read-only: prints the tree a
  migration would write, from an existing project's database. Run against the
  author's real project it reports **55 folders, 283 documents, 46 of them
  carrying their own prose as `index.html`, 282 names normalised by the
  no-spaces rule, 8 collisions needing a suffix, 0 problems.**
  *The 46 was wrong when written, and is stale now.* `f0803c4` (2026-10-25)
  showed those are Qt's stylesheet-only empty documents and titles typed once
  as headings — neither is prose. Re-run 2026-10-26: **51 folders, 281
  documents, 0 index.html**, and the 0 was checked *against the files* with
  an independent HTML text extraction rather than through `has_prose` alone,
  because a wrong `has_prose` would make the round-trip gate agree with the
  writer and pass while dropping prose. No container in the author's project
  holds a sentence of its own, so none needs an `index.html`.
- **`src/lekhak/layout.py`** and **`tests/test_layout.py`** (20 tests) — the
  core: name rules, the YAML-subset frontmatter and manifests, `write_tree`
  and `load_tree`, and the order guarantees below.

### Assumptions made, for the author to confirm or overturn

1. **A folder's title lives in the database row, and its name on disk.**
   Found while building: a directory name is only a slug, so the real title
   has nowhere else to live. The row's `title` holds it, and the file's
   frontmatter holds it too, so the file is complete on its own.
2. **Combining marks survive in filenames.** A mark is not a space: `अंत`
   stays `अंत` and `café` stays `café` rather than being hyphenated mid-word.
3. **Values are quoted whenever unquoting them would change them** (amended
   2026-10-26). The earlier rule — "numeric-looking values are not quoted, so
   `Count: 3` reads back as the number 3" — quoted only a hand-picked list of
   words, and silently retyped `007` to `7`. A *string* is now quoted unless
   the parser would read it back as that exact string; numbers and booleans
   the model genuinely holds are written bare and come back as their type.
   So `Count: "3"` is the text 3, `word_target: 3` is the number 3, and a
   hand-written bare `3` still reads as a number (YAML's own habit).
4. **`index.html` is not a child.** It is the container's own prose, so the
   scan skips it when listing children — otherwise a chapter's text appeared
   as one of its scenes.
5. **Files added from outside append**, in name order after the manifest's
   children, rather than being inserted somewhere clever. The manifest is the
   order; new things go last.
6. **The dry-run script still carries its own copy of the slug function**
   rather than importing `lekhak.layout.slug` — a tidy-up for the next pass,
   now that there is one place for it.

### What the order guarantees actually are

- `write_tree` writes each folder's children **in the order given**, and
  records exactly those names in the manifest.
- `load_tree` reads the manifest first and consults the directory only for
  names it does not already know.
- Tests pin both: titles that would sort `1, 10, 2` stay in binder order, and
  one test **edits a manifest by hand and watches the tree follow it** — the
  proof that filenames are never consulted for order.
- A document renamed by hand keeps its identity, because the `id` lives in the
  frontmatter.

### Next, in order

1. **An adapter on `Project`: build `Node`s from the database, and read a tree
   back into the model — DONE (see below).**
2. **The migration writer: `write_tree` from the real database, then read it
   back and compare every document before the flat pool is retired — DONE
   (`scripts/storage_roundtrip.py`, below).**
3. Writer operations in the new model: create, rename, move, reorder, delete —
   atomic renames wherever the filesystem allows.
4. Trash and the areas; extract and nest; then the example project.

### The adapter and the gate (2026-10-26)

`Project.to_nodes()` is the adapter: a container is a folder whatever its
stored kind, a leaf is a document, `Type` becomes the node's own field and
everything else the writer keeps stays in `metadata`.
`Project.write_tree()` writes the binder out; `read_tree()` reads it back.
The two helpers `flatten_promoted_books()` and `unwrap_folder()` exist
because the old import wrapped a book in a same-named chapter — the folder
*is* the book now.

**`scripts/storage_roundtrip.py` is the gate.** It copies the project to a
temporary directory (the real one is never opened for writing), writes the
tree, reads it back and compares every document field by field — id, title,
type, synopsis, target, metadata, content and binder order. It then does
something the round trip *cannot*: it reads the schema directly and lists
fields the layout has **nowhere to put**, because a column nobody writes is
invisible to a comparison and would be dropped by a migration with nothing
failing.

It runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` first, for a reason worth keeping: a corrupt
index makes index-backed queries return phantom rows, which reads as a bug in
the layout rather than in the database.

**Result on the author's project (2026-10-26): the round trip is exact** —
all 332 documents match, and `integrity_check` is `ok`. Four fields remain
unhomed, all at **0 rows**: `page_break`, `doc_template`, `value_type`,
`options_json`.

Two things were found by building this, both fixed:

- **The author's project had a corrupt `document_parent_order` index.**
  `integrity_check` failed with *"wrong # of entries"*; `count(*)` said 334
  rows against a table holding 332, `Templates` listed four children of which
  three were the same id, and `_descendant_ids()` — which feeds
  `delete_document` — returned that id three times. Repaired with `REINDEX`
  on 2026-10-26 after a backup (`backups/<stamp>-pre-reindex`, named outside
  the pruning stamp so pruning never touches it). The table was never wrong;
  only the index was. Two orphaned `.html` files on disk are the other half
  of the same event, and are exactly what `delete_document`'s own documented
  row-before-file order predicts a crash would leave.
- **The frontmatter writer turned text into numbers.** `_scalar` quoted a
  hand-picked set of words, so `Count: 007` read back as `7` and
  `Word: 2026` as `2026` — metadata rewritten by a round trip nobody asked
  for. The rule is now one that cannot miss: *a string is quoted unless
  `_value` would read it back as that exact string*, and `_value` parses
  floats so real numbers (print geometry is inches) keep their type. The
  corpus had no leading-zero values, which is why the first gate run still
  reported an exact round trip.

**`is_templates_root` and `page_setup` now have a home** (the two non-zero
gaps the gate first reported): both are folder-scoped, so both live in
`folder.yaml` — which is what makes a copied book a book with its own trim.
`page_setup` is validated by `clean_page_setup`, never by the loader: a
hand-broken geometry loads and then fails where everything else fails it,
rather than being silently dropped where the writer would never see it.
`project_metadata` rides in `project.yaml`'s `settings`. *(Both flags have
since been deleted outright — the second decision below.)*

Suite 669, exit 0; lint at the pre-existing baseline (337); every file parses
as Python 3.9. Mutations caught: the manifest write of `templates_root`, the
old quote rule, float parsing removed, and `to_nodes` dropping
`templates_root` — the last reported by the gate as
`'Templates': templates_root True -> False` and `'Default': …`, exit 1.

### Decided: templates are folders on disk, found by location or a mark (2026-10-26)

> **Revised 2026-10-28 — see the next section:** the mark never earned its
> keep and is gone; discovery is by location alone.

The binder-document template system (`is_templates_root`, the `Templates`
binder folder, `book_settings["template"]` as a folder id) is **deleted**
(`1b4005d`) — it rendered nothing: the author's project had `Default` nested inside
`Templates` with both flagged as roots, 0 words, and no book assigning a
template, so every export was already driven by the on-disk slot files in
`<project>/templates/`. The decided model (`docs/TEMPLATES.md`): a template
is a folder of HTML fragments on disk; discovery lists
`<project>/templates/` automatically and any other folder **only when
explicitly marked**; the Templates view (not a binder container) shows the
shipped default with Duplicate. The column did not simply vanish: its
*meaning* moved down a level. `is_template` marks the template folder
itself, and a migration on open marks each old area's direct children,
zeroes the area flags and drops the old column (guarded for SQLite <
3.35) — an area nested inside an area becomes a template of the outer one
and keeps its own children. `folder.yaml` writes `is_template` in place
of `templates_root`, so a copied template stays a template.

### Revised: the mark is gone, the disk is the whole answer (2026-10-28)

That mark was a *second* concept of "template" competing with the folder on
disk, and it ended up listed nowhere worth looking at (the author's call,
`docs/TEMPLATES.md` §1.1). Deleted end to end: the column — the migration
now drops **both** `is_templates_root` and `is_template`, guarded for
SQLite < 3.35, with no data to migrate since nothing in the new model reads
either — plus `set_template`, `template_folders`, the export exclusion, the
italic cues in both trees, the inspector checkbox and the binder's mark
actions. `folder.yaml` no longer writes `is_template`; an old manifest
still carrying one reads as simply not marking anything.

What is left is one rule: **a template is a folder under
`<project>/templates/`**, holding files rather than binder documents, so
manuscript and templates cannot collide and word counts and whole-project
export need no exclusion at all. A folder outside `templates/` becomes a
template by being moved there. Same session, two more decisions that live
in the same folder: a **subfolder named for a format** (`html`, `epub`,
`docx`, `pdf`, `text`) refines a set's root for that format's exports
(`docs/TEMPLATES.md` §1.3), and a single file can be **copied out** of a
set as a new set of its own (§1.2). The three shipped sets keep their
slots forever: a project folder called `default` is listed after them as a
row of its own and never answers to the shipped name.

### Decided: the writer never meets a slug (author, 2026-10-26)

**Collisions are a filesystem problem, and the filesystem solves them.**
Duplicate titles are numbered *in the filename only* — the binder keeps
showing the title the writer typed, duplicates and all.

The author's project makes this the common case rather than the exception:
**16 titles appear more than once** — nine `Untitled`, five
`A Place, Sector 7`, four each of `Epilogue` and
`1---A Place, Sector 7`, three `Prologue`, and both `Epilogue`
and `epilogue`, which collide case-insensitively on macOS and Windows.
All of them get distinct files and identical binder titles.

**A blank title stays blank.** If the writer put nothing in the binder
title it stays empty (or `Untitled`, whichever they typed); it is never
filled in from the filename. A document with no frontmatter *at all* is
the one case that still takes its title from its file — that file was
written by another hand, and its name is the only name it has.

This was a live bug, not a policy question. The reader fell back to the
filename whenever the title was *empty* as well as absent, so two blank
titles came back as `Untitled` and `Untitled-1`: the disambiguation number
leaking into the binder, which is precisely the slug a writer is not meant
to see. `_named()` now distinguishes absent from empty, and
`_folder_values()` keeps a keyed-but-empty manifest title instead of
dropping it as unwritten.

### Still open, and the author's to decide

`page_break`, `doc_template`, `document_metadata.value_type` and
`options_json` have no home in the tree. All four are at 0 rows in the
author's project today, so nothing is at risk *now* — but 1.6 and 2.1 both
put real values in the first two, and 1.14 puts real ones in the last two,
so the moment a writer uses those features the gate will start reporting
rows that a migration would drop.

### Assumptions made, for the author to confirm or overturn
